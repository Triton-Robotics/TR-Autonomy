# TR-Autonomy-2025
Parent repository for Triton Robotics Autonomy team. It contains the setup files to run on Jetson boot (when connected to the robot), and contains the submodules of all the necessary child nodes. 

This repository should only include final, runnable code that follows coding conventions in [Styles.md](./Styles.md) and works on our Jetson.
